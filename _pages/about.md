# 🧐 About me
I’m currently in my fourth year of undergraduate studies at Tianjin University 🏫, majoring in Computer Science. I'm supervised by Prof.[Qilong Wang](https://csqlwang.github.io/homepage/) to complete my undergraduate project. Next year, I will start to pursue my master's degree with him.
My research interest includes **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Architecture Design & Optimization**. I’m currently learning compression methods based on the ViT.
If you have any questions, feel free to discuss with me. 😉
